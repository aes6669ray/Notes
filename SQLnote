SELECT p.ProductName , e.LastName , o.ShipCountry , count(*) as times, sum(od.quantity*od.unitprice)
FROM `products` as p, `orders` as o , `order details` as od, `employees` as e
WHERE o.OrderID = od.OrderID AND p.ProductID = od.ProductID AND
      e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID AND p.ProductName = "Tofu"
GROUP BY o.ShipCountry,e.EmployeeID
order by times;


#SELECT p.ProductName , e.LastName , count(*) as times, sum(od.quantity*od.unitprice) as my
#FROM `products` as p, `orders` as o , `order details` as od, `employees` as e
#WHERE o.OrderID = od.OrderID AND p.ProductID = od.ProductID AND
#      e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID AND p.ProductName = "Tofu"
#GROUP BY  o.EmployeeID
#ORDER BY `my`  DESC;
##少了group by o.ShipCountry 與select中的o.ShipCountry就可以看出哪個員工對於這個產品賣最好(而且是依照賺錢程度，不是賣的次數)
